/*
 * Traffic light system. v.1.2
 * By Tijam Moradi
 * 
 * System has three leds; green, yellow and red. Default emitting 
 * is red. If sensor (or button) notices activity (HIGH), light will turn green.
 * Light will remain green while sensor is occasionally triggered upon treshold.
 * If treshold is triggered on 4 green cycles, red light wil lbe forced. 
 * 
 * If you want to extend this program, Ã½ou can start by adding sensors to 
 * see if many cars are in queue. Also switch light to red / green can be animated with 
 * specific functions. For further extension there could be more lights and parallel 
 * queue tracking.
